# Focus Fins

- API routes will go in [`./api/`](/api/)
- Front end will go in [`./client/`](/client/)
- [`./main.js`](/main.js) is the main server file
- any CSS files is TBD (still deciding on how to style our pages)

## Dev Server
To host a development server to check your work, execute these commands in two seperate terminals: \
`npm run dev-client` \
`npm run dev-server` \
Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

## Contributing
- Make sure to make your own branch to push to, name it 'yourname-featurename', once complete make a pull request
- Be descriptive of what changes you make in your commit messages and pull request. (doesn't have to be crazy I just don't want 'idk' or 'some changes' as commits)
- PLEASE KEEP GOOD CODE STYLE, if possible use a code linter
- Branches are automatically deleted on merge to master

Rest of README is WIP
